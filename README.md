# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

[My Password Generator.](https://a-thread.github.io/Password-Generator-Aiden/)

The assignment was to create an application that generates a random password with user-selected criteria. It needed to run in the browser and feature a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It also needed to be clean, polished, and responsive to multiple screen sizes. 

## Styling

I used Bootstrap to streamline the look of the page and make it more responsive to multiple screen sizes, cleaning up the local CSS sheet to get rid of unnecessary styling.
