# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

[My Password Generator.](https://a-thread.github.io/Password-Generator-Aiden/)

The assignment was to create an application that generates a random password with user-selected criteria. It needed to run in the browser and feature a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It also needed to be clean, polished, and responsive to multiple screen sizes. 

## Styling

I used Bootstrap to streamline the look of the page and make it more responsive to multiple screen sizes, cleaning up the local CSS sheet to get rid of unnecessary styling. Below you will see on the left the original look and on the right, my updated site.
